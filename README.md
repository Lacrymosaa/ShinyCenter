# Shiny Center

**Shiny Center** is a complete overhaul of my previous repository, **Shiny Chain Calculator**, reimagined as a multi-tool platform designed to assist with shiny hunting in Pokémon games.

While the primary feature remains an accurate **Shiny Chain Odds Calculator**, the project has been expanded to include several new tools and a cleaner, more modern layout. Additionally, all information is now provided in English, replacing the older Spanish documentation used for encounter locations.

## Key Features (v1.0)

- **Soft Reset Counter** – Track your soft reset attempts easily.
- **Shiny Breeding Counter** – Monitor breeding progress toward a shiny Pokémon.
- **Hunting List** – Organize and manage your ongoing and planned hunts.

These new features, combined with the updated interface, comprise version 1.0 of the **Shiny Center**. The platform is available for the **Pokémon Unbreakable Ties** community at the following link:
